                Fully committed to life-long learning, 
            I’m a full stack developer and IT technician with a love for JavaScript, 
            C++, and all things related to development. I have a passion for problem 
            solving and creativity which drives my excitement for being productive. 
            I've enjoyed working in places ranging from small start-ups to large enterprises.
            When I’m not in front of my computer I like to spend my time reading, hanging out with friends and playing music.
